# 🩸 Anemia Detection AI (Leo Club Pilot)

### 🌍 Overview  
A **low-cost AI tool** to detect anemia from **phone photos of the conjunctiva** (inner eyelid).  
Piloted with **50 rural schoolgirls** via **Leo Club (Lions International)**.

> **Preliminary Result:** 88% agreement with lab hemoglobin in pilot (n=50).  
> _Not clinically validated. Research prototype._

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Early, accessible anemia screening  
- Reduce school absenteeism  
- Empower community health workers  

---

### 🧠 Tech Stack  
- Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow  
- MobileNetV2 (transfer learning)  
- Runs on Android (future)

### 📊 Pilot Impact (Self-Reported)
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| School Absenteeism | 65% | **<40%** |
| Anemia Awareness | 20% | **85%** |
| Health Confidence | 30% | **90%** |

---

### 🔍 How It Works  
1. Take photo of **inner lower eyelid**  
2. AI analyzes **color & texture**  
3. Get **risk score** in seconds

### 💻 Demo Code (Placeholder)
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

img = cv2.imread('eye_sample.jpg')
if img is None:
    print("Error: Image not found.")
else:
    redness = np.mean(img[:, :, 2])  # crude red channel
    risk = max(0, min(100, (255 - redness) * 0.8))
    print(f"Redness: {redness:.1f} → Risk: {risk:.1f}% (SIMULATED)")<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="EFE64979-F05D-41A2-8284-6A5F59AFD3B7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9d921da-c4ae-40aa-93ff-83b33085c7a3" />
